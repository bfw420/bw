#### **About Page:**

WHY I SERVE

For 20 years as a GP in Claremont, I saw the same story repeat:
Good people suffering because of bad policy.

Patients denied pain relief because of outdated cannabis laws.
Families crushed by healthcare costs.
Communities ignored by politicians who don't listen.

I could keep treating symptoms, or I could fight to fix the system.

So in 2021, I ran for Parliament.

Now I'm your voice in the Legislative Council - still seeing patients
every week, still fighting for the healthcare and reforms WA deserves.

Because the best way to heal communities is to change the laws that
hurt them.

## 🔥 Emotional Triggers to Leverage

### **1. Frustration with Status Quo**
```
Tired of politicians who promise everything and deliver nothing?
So am I. That's why I publish my voting record, my policy proposals,
and my economic analysis.

Evidence, not empty promises.

### **What Makes Dr Walker Different:**

#### **USP #1: Still Practicing Medicine**
```
"The Only Doctor in WA Parliament Still Seeing Patients"

Most politicians talk about healthcare from a distance.
I'm in the clinic every week, seeing the real impact of policy failures.

When I vote on health policy, I know exactly how it affects you.
Because I'm treating you.
